# Multivariate_Classification

I am working with a UCI dataset which can be found at- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

The whole idea behind this is to see how one can get around a Multi-variate dataset which requires you to perform classification task. I have used different models along with hyper parameter tuning to find the one which performs the best. Also, we find features out of all the list of features that turn out to be most important while making predictions.
